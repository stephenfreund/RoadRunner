To Install:
-----------

1. You will need Ant, Java 1.7 or 1.8, and cpp to build RoadRunner. 
   The $JAVA_HOME environment variable must point to the proper
   Java distribution.  (Depending on the Java version, you may need
   to add tools.jar from the JDK to your classpath in build.xml or
   in Eclipse.)

2. Unzip the dist file, and cd into the top-level directory.

3. Build the source:

	> cd RoadRunner; ant
	
To Run:
-------

1. cd RoadRunner

2. source msetup

	Note: this sets up environment variables and configures 
	      everything for a specific machine -- change as necessary.  
	      
3. Test it:

 
	> javac test/Test.java
	> rrrun test.Test

   You should get no errors.

	> rrrun -tool=TL:RS:LS test.Test

   You should get many race errors on field Test.y.
   Test with FastTrack:
   
   	> rrrun -tool=FT2 test.Test
	
4.  Look at options:

    	 > rrrun -help

    You will at least want to look at the following:

     -quiet                         
     -help                          
     -classpath={String}            
     -toolpath={String}             
     -tool={String}                 

     -classes={StringMatcher}       
     -fields={StringMatcher}        
     -methods={StringMatcher}       

     -array={ArrayMode}             
     -field={FieldMode}             

     -nobarrier

5.  Look at sample tools:

     	 > rrrun -tools

    Look at rr.tool.Tool abstract class and sample tools for
    implementation info.
    

6.  Running on benchmarks:

    When performing comparisons to other analysis platforms, you will
    need to pay particular attention to several options, including 
    -array and -field to ensure memory is instrumented as you intend. 

    In addition, RoadRunner includes specialized handling of various
    barrier implementations to facilitate writing analyses that must
    treat barriers specially.  However, it assumes those barriers are
    correct, which is not the case for some benchmarks, including 
    the barriers in JavaGrande.  Thus, you will miss errors unless 
    you specify the "-nobarrier" flag to not treat barrier code 
    specially.


ECLIPSE SUPPORT:
-----------

After building as described above, you can import the RoadRunner directory
as an existing project.  
   
Refresh, Clean, etc. should rebuild everything as
necessary.  The "rrrun script" will pick up any modifications you made.

If adding new Tools, changing abbreviations, tools paths, changing the ClassLoader,
changing the agent, or doing anything else unusual, you should rebuilt 
RoadRunner with the build.xml ant script to ensure all the auto-generated 
files are in sync.

There is a sample launch script "scripts/RRMain-tools.launch" to print out all 
the supported tools from inside Eclipse if you wish to work exclusively
in the Eclipse environment.
